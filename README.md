# Embody

## Overview

Embody is a revolutionary web application designed to track recovery progress from physical injuries while considering mental health and overall lifestyle. Unlike traditional recovery tracking tools that focus solely on physical rehabilitation, Embody integrates multiple facets of well-beingâ€”physical health, mental health, exercise, and sleep qualityâ€”to provide a holistic view of recovery.

At its core, Embody leverages machine learning models to analyze user data, offering insightful visualizations and personalized recovery progress reports. By combining real-time tracking with intelligent analysis, Embody ensures users receive data-driven guidance on their journey to full recovery.

## Tech Stack & Tools Used

Embody is built using the latest technologies to ensure high performance, scalability, and an intuitive user experience:

### Frontend:

- **Vite** â€“ Fast build tool for modern web applications
- **TypeScript** â€“ Enhancing reliability and maintainability
- **React** â€“ Dynamic and responsive UI development
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first styling for efficient design

### Backend & Database:

- **Supabase** â€“ Secure user authentication and data storage
- **Node.js & Express.js** (Planned for backend logic and API handling)

### Machine Learning:

- Custom-trained **ML models** powering each tracker
- Another additional model aggregating all tracker results for a final recovery progress report
- **Currently, 3 models are operational, with the remaining 2 in development and to be integrated soon.**

## Features

- **Holistic Recovery Tracking**: Tracks not only physical health but also mental well-being, exercise habits, and sleep quality.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Each tracker is backed by an ML model to provide accurate, data-driven analysis.
- **Comprehensive Recovery Report**: A unique 5th model aggregates all individual tracker results for a final, holistic progress report.
- **Data Visualization**: Intuitive, easy-to-read graphs help users monitor trends and make informed decisions.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Every user has a personal account with securely stored data using Supabase.
- **Data Privacy & Security**: User data is encrypted and securely stored, ensuring compliance with best security practices.
- **Dyslexic-Friendly Text**: Users have the option to enable dyslexic-friendly fonts for improved readability.
- **Night Mode**: A dark theme option is available for better accessibility and user comfort.

## Technical Workflow

1. **User Authentication**

   - Users log in using their credentials via Supabase authentication.
   - Secure data storage ensures privacy and accessibility.

2. **Data Entry & Tracking**

   - Users input relevant data into four trackers: Physical Health, Mental Health, Exercise, and Sleep Quality.
   - Each tracker processes the input through a dedicated ML model.

3. **Machine Learning Processing**

   - Each trackerâ€™s ML model analyzes and returns personalized insights.
   - The 5th ML model compiles data from all trackers to generate a final recovery report.

4. **Data Visualization**

   - All results are displayed via interactive and easy-to-read graphs.
   - Users can track progress over time, identifying patterns and improvements.

5. **Final Report Generation**

   - The system provides a comprehensive summary of the userâ€™s recovery journey.
   - Insights help users adjust their routines for optimal rehabilitation.
